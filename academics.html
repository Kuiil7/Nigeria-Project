        Duglu School for the Deaf (Duglu SD) was established on January 17, 2005. Duglu SD is located about 15 Kilometres south of Lafia, the capital of Nasarawa State. Duglu SD is ideally located to serve the entire state if its growth trajectory can be accelerated thereby enabling it to adopt the residential practice common in Schools for the Deaf in Nigeria which are built to serve entire states as distinct from localities or interest or demographic groups. Because it has limited private support, it is currently accessible only to day students. The introduction of boarding facilities will make it truly accessible to the entire population of the state at large.
